# Locker needed because of the asynchronous behaviour of nodejs. The same
# data can be modified by two requests at the same time because node handle
# both requests without waiting the database response. So with this lock
# this system, if a data is accessed next request wait until data gets free
# before being executed.
# A lock has a time to live of 2s
